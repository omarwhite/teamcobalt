### Concept
Our proposal for the first game design project involving the theme of adaptation is a small-scale game in which the player plays as a chameleon trying to survive through seasons in a nuclear wasteland. The player is tasked with moving around an area to catch bugs, some mutated, some not, falling from the sky to maintain hunger levels and avoid starvation. The player can use the chameleon to fire its tongue upwards and catch any bugs caught in its wake. As the player survives further into the game, elements will begin to change. Seasons will begin to change, and patches of grass, dead leaves, and snow will begin to collect on the ground allowing the player to hunker down and blend in to avoid occasional bird threats. Seasons will also impact the amount of food available as well as the weather. After two cycles of seasons, spring through winter, after which the game will shift to a nuclear winter. During this nuclear winter, the game will be technically over. Seasons will cease to change and the player will need to survive until starvation.

### Narrative

#### Characters
- Chameleon
- Bugs
  - Firefly
  - Fly
  - Dragon Fly
  - Etc.
- Birds

#### Setting
A field outside of a nuclear power plant taking place in all seasons (Spring - Winter).

#### Story
You are a chameleon trying to keep from starving throughout your life. Adapting to the mutations caused by nuclear waste and abundance, or lack thereof depending on the season, of bugs.

### Theme
Arcade Survival.

### Timeline
The game will begin in the spring and will progress through multiple seasons over time.

## Gameplay

### Goals
- Survive until the Nuclear Winter, two cycles of seasons (spring - winter). After which it is eternally lacking in bugs and mutation effects are increased. Survive this winter for as long as possible and gain the highest score.

### Mechanics / Interaction
- Stretch Tongue
  - Different strengths / Lengths depending on mutation
- Hide from prey, the bird. Do this by standing on “hidden” tiles.
- Avoid falling debris by moving left and right

### Challenges
Different seasons will have different effects on the game. During winters food will be scarce and add a challenge to the game.

### Win / Lose Conditions
- If the player cannot survive until the Nuclear Winter they will lose. If the player survives until after the Nuclear Winter, they will win the game and have the opportunity to increase their score until they get a game over.
